We try to maintain a list of all the stations in Belgium using CSV so everyone can help to maintain it on github. Furthermore, we have a PHP composer/packagist library for you to go from station name to ID and vice versa and we convert the CSV file to JSON-LD for maximum semantic interoperability.

## Fields we collect

### stations.csv

 * `URI`: this is the URI where we can find more information (such as the real-time departures) about this station (this already contains the ID of the NMBS/SNCB as well)
 * `longitude`: the longitude of the station
 * `latitude`: the latitude of the station
 * `name`: the most neutral name of the station (e.g., in Wallonia use the French name, for Brussels use both, for Flanders use nl name)
 * `alternative-fr`: alt. name in French, if available
 * `alternative-nl`: alt. name in Dutch, if available
 * `alternative-de`: alt. name in German, if available
 * `alternative-en`: alt. name in English, if available
 * `country-code`: the code of the country the station belongs to

### stops.csv

 * `URI`: this is the URI where we can find more information about this stop/platform (exists out of URI of the parent station + '#' + platform code)
 * `parent_stop`: this is the URI of the parent stop defined in stations.csv
 * `longitude`: the longitude of the stop
 * `latitude`: the latitude of the stop
 * `name`: parent station name
 * `platform`: the platform code

## Build the RDF or JSON-LD

Using scripts, we convert this to JSON-LD. In order to run the script, run this command:

First time run this in your terminal (nodejs needs to be installed on your system):

```bash
npm install
```

Or install it globally using the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/irail-stations) (you will need to run this again when there's an update to the stations file):
```bash
npm install -g irail-stations
```

From then on, you can always run:

```bash
# using this repo
./bin/build.js
# or with the global package:
irail-stations
```

For extra commands, check:

```bash
./bin/build.js --help
# or
irail-stations --help
```

We currently support the output formats __TRiG__, __N-Quads__ and __JSON-LD__ (default)

## In case you just want to reuse the data

### Latest update over HTTP

JSON-LD is available at https://irail.be/stations/NMBS if you add the right accept header. For example, using curl on the command line, you would do this:

```bash
curl -H "accept: application/json" https://irail.be/stations/NMBS
```

If you want to change this output, please change the CSV files over here first (we love pull requests)

### In PHP project

Using composer (mind that we also require nodejs to be installed on your system):
```bash
composer require irail/stations
```

Then you can use the stations in your code as follows:
```php
use irail\stations\Stations;
// getStations() returns a json-ld document
$brusselsnorth = Stations::getStations("Brussels North")->{"@graph"}[0];
// getStationByID($id) returns a simple object with the station or null
$ghentstpieters = Stations::getStationByID("http://irail.be/stations/NMBS/008892007");
```

Don't forget to do a `composer update` from time to time to update the data
